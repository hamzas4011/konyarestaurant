## 🌟 About the Project  
This frontend project was created for the course **Webutvikling 2** in collaboration with my classmate, **Fazal**. The project focused on building a website for a fictional Turkish restaurant, **Konya Restaurant**.  

While this repository contains the **frontend** implementation, the overall project is a **fullstack web application**, combining a Vue.js frontend with a backend developed in **C#**.  

### Key Features:  
- 📜 **Menu Display:** Showcase of the restaurant's menu items.  
- ⭐ **Menu Rating:** Users can rate individual menu items.  
- 🛒 **Shopping Cart:** Add menu items to the shopping cart for a seamless user experience.  
- 🔄 **Backend Integration:**  
  - The frontend connects to a backend developed in **C#**, which implements full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing the menu and shopping cart data.  
  - The C# backend project is maintained in a **separate repository**:  
    [KonyaRestaurantAPI](https://github.com/hamzas4011/KonyaRestaurantAPI).  

### Technology:  
- **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js  
- **Backend:** C# with CRUD operations (in a separate folder/repository)
